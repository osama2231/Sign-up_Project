# Sign-up_Project

Hello fellas
Hope you are doing great

This project, as the name suggests, is about Sign-up form.

I used HTML and CSS to complete this project.

What I have learned:

- how to display a picture as a half background in a webpage
- how to position the logo relative to the picture
- how to use the form element with its inputs and align them properly
